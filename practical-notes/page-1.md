| DNS Record                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| `Resource Record`            | A domain name, usually a fully qualified domain name, is the first part of a Resource Record. If you don't use a fully qualified domain name, the zone's name where the record is located will be appended to the end of the name.                                     |
| `TTL`                        | In seconds, the Time-To-Live (`TTL`) defaults to the minimum value specified in the SOA record.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `Record Class`               | Internet, Hesiod, or Chaos                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `Start Of Authority` (`SOA`) | It should be first in a zone file because it indicates the start of a zone. Each zone can only have one `SOA` record, and additionally, it contains the zone's values, such as a serial number and multiple expiration timeouts.                                       |
| `Name Servers` (`NS`)        | The distributed database is bound together by `NS` Records. They are in charge of a zone's authoritative name server and the authority for a child zone to a name server.                                                                                              |
| `IPv4 Addresses` (`A`)       | The A record is only a mapping between a hostname and an IP address. 'Forward' zones are those with `A` records.                                                                                                                                                       |
| `Pointer` (`PTR`)            | The PTR record is a mapping between an IP address and a hostname. 'Reverse' zones are those that have `PTR` records.                                                                                                                                                   |
| `Canonical Name` (`CNAME`)   | An alias hostname is mapped to an `A` record hostname using the `CNAME` record.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `Mail Exchange` (`MX`)       | The `MX` record identifies a host that will accept emails for a specific host. A priority value has been assigned to the specified host. Multiple MX records can exist on the same host, and a prioritized list is made consisting of the records for a specific host. |
